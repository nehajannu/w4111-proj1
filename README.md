# COMS 4111 Project 1: Columbia Buy & Sell
We want to create a database that emulates the Facebook marketplace page for Columbia Buy & Sell. The domain is to provide an interface that allows students to easily list, search, and purchase items on campus. After signing up with a valid CUID, student can buy and sell items on the website. One portion of the application would allow the user to add a product to a storefront for the other users of the application to see. The other portion would resemble an online shopping website's interface where each product has a category attached to it, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
